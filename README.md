## Priority Scheduling

This algorithm follows a method according to which, a priority number (integer) is assigned to the processes ready to be executed, then the process to be selected for execution has the lower or higher priority number, depending on the operating system we are on.
There are two types of priority scheduling algorithms:
1. Priority preemptive scheduling: If during the execution time of a process a process with a higher priority has reached, the CPU will be allocated to the newly reached process.
2. Priority nonpreemptive scheduling: The process that has the highest priority will be executed until its termination even if during this time a process that has the highest priority arrives.
