## Priority Scheduling
Priority Scheduling is an algorithm where a priority number (integer) is assigned to each process that is ready to be executed. The process with the highest or lowest priority number, depending on the operating system, is selected for execution.
### Types of Priority Scheduling Algorithm
1. Priority Preemptive Scheduling: In this type, if a process with a higher priority arrives while another process is being executed, the CPU will be allocated to the newly arrived process.

2. Priority Non-preemptive Scheduling: In this type, the process with the highest priority is executed until it completes, even if a higher priority process arrives during its execution.
